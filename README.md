Look in the source files.
- You will need to enter your username and password in renew.py
- You will need to amend your email service (e.g. gmail) in the testEmail.py file

- I recommend setting this up as a scheduled job/cron job every few days

TO DO:
- Work around a book being requested and thus failing to be renewed
- Web interface -- a complete service for you lazy people ;-)
